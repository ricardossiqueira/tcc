# Backend checklist

 - [x] Get container details by id (script, propmpt and status)
 - [x] Get statistics from container (avg start time, avg stop time, # of requests and type of requests)
 - [x] Add human readable id
 - [ ] Add AI short description to containers
 - [ ] Docker pull image if image is not found (secondary issue)
 - [ ] LLM system prompt on db (secondary issue)
 - [ ] LLM model selection (secondary issue)
 - [ ] Create container stats on container creation
 - [ ] Webhook/SSE to notify frontend about container status changes (up requests are taking too long on VPS and it's timing out)
